					Hey, I&apos;m Jacob Herper

				<h2 className="mt-2 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl">
					Senior Software Engineer from the UK
				</h2>
				<p className="mt-8">
					As a passionate front-end developer, I create amazing websites and web
					apps to make the internet a better place. I am an advocate for web
					performance and accessibility as well as a JAMstack enthusiast with
					experience in serverless technologies.
				</p>
				<p className="my-4">
					I am &radic;1,024 years old and have been a web developer for as long
					as I can think. The technologies I work with are JavaScript, HTML and
					CSS with a focus on the frameworks React.js, Gatsby, Next.js, Node and
					Express. I use code not only to do my day-to-day job, but also to
					solve everyday problems I come across.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I am not writing code I love to spend time with my wife and
					five-year-old daughter at home in England or travelling around the
					world. We are quite a multi-cultural family with me having grown up in
					Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª and my wife being from Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½, which is why we raise our
					daughter trilingual. I myself speak five languages (some better than
					others). Furthermore I enjoy cooking fresh food when I come home after
					a long day at the office.
